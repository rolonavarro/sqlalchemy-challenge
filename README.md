# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this repository I created a project where I analyzed the climate of Hawaii,
using sqlalchemy and created several interesting tables. I also used Flask to create several API's in JSON format where people can access and see several trends of Hawaii's weather.

### Resources
In this file, I have all of the data used such as CSV files and SQLite.

### Results
In this file, you can find all of the code.

## Instructions
* Clone the repo to your computer
* You can see the app by running in your command line by entering "python app.py"
* In your web browser type localhost:5000 you can look at the JSON files
